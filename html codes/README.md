# Overview

I used the google maps api software to create a map of all the places I have been. The data used is location I visited in the past. This software works much like google maps would without the search bar, hovering or clicking on the markers will display the name of each location, even with the ability to go into street view via the little orange person.

I wrote this software to demonstrate my ability to work with google maps and incorporate it into a web page.
